            "  \"description\": \"<b>A celebration of dogs, the scientists who've lived alongside them, and how canines have been key to advancements in science for the betterment of all species.</b><br /><br />Almost everywhere there are humans on planet Earth, there are dogs<i>.</i>&nbsp;But what do dogs know and understand of the world? Do their emotions feel like our own? Do they love like we do? What do they think of us?<br /> <br /> Since our alliance first began on the hunt and on the farm, our relationship with dogs has evolved considerably. And with domestic dog population rising twenty per cent in the last decade alone, it is a bond that will continue to evolve. In order to gauge where our relationship with dogs goes from here, author and zoologist Jules Howard takes a look at the historical paths we have trod together, and at the many scientists before him who turned their analytic eye on their own four-legged companions.<br /> <br /> Charles Darwin and his contemporaries toyed with dog sign language&nbsp;and made special puzzle boxes and elaborate sniff tests using old socks. Later, the same questions drove Pavlov and Pasteur to unspeakable cruelty in their search for knowledge. Since then, leagues of psychologists and animal behaviourists have built upon the study of dogs and their much-improved methods have fetched increasingly important results: dogs have episodic&nbsp;memory similar to ours; they recognise themselves as individuals; and, in addition to their expert sense of smell, dogs’ noses can even detect thermal radiation.<br /> <br /> &nbsp;With the help of vets, ethologists, neurologists, historians&nbsp;and, naturally, his own dogs,&nbsp;<i>Wonderdog</i>&nbsp;reveals the study of dogs to be key in the advancement of compassion in scientific research, and crucial to making life on Earth better for all species.\",\n",

Outside is the world from which she has been severed: her young son, Jackson, and the San Francisco of her youth. Inside is a new reality: thousands of women hustling for the bare essentials needed to survive; the bluffing and pageantry and casual acts of violence by guards and prisoners alike; and the deadpan absurdities of institutional living, portrayed with great humor and precision.<br /> <br /> Stunning and unsentimental, <i>The Mars Room</i> is “wholly authentic…profound…luminous” (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>),<b> </b> “one of those books that enrage you even as they break your heart” (<i>The New York Times Book Review, </i>cover review)—a spectacularly compelling, heart-stopping novel about a life gone off the rails in contemporary America. It is audacious and tragic, propulsive and yet beautifully refined and “affirms Rachel Kushner as one of our best novelists” (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>).\",\n",

Until Huck realizes in order to hold onto what he loves most he will have to let not only Becky go but a part of who he is, what he is, perhaps the best part. For Becky no matter where she has gone in the universe, no matter how many planets she set her wandering feet on, home wasn't a place, it was a who. Until her father and lifeline died. When a half evil alien presents himself demanding love and acceptance, Becky is determined to fight the hardest battle in her life. Home will become one powerful male, if Huck can be saved. There is no greater war at times, than the fight fought from within.\",\n",

When Libby asks his help to hide her feminine identity from the world, Ziyaeddin agrees on one condition: she must sit for him to paint—as a woman.

            "  \"description\": \"<b>Anthony Swofford follows his international bestseller, <i>Jarhead,</i> with an unforgettable first novel -- a powerful story about a youth spent on a U.S. air base in Japan and the gritty neon streets just outside it, where the Japanese underworld lurks and a rebellious young girl finds herself in great danger.</b> <br /> <br /> Anthony Swofford took the literary world by storm with <i>Jarhead,</i> his electrifying memoir of serving as a U.S. marine in the Gulf War. Celebrated for its visceral candor and profane lyricism, <i>Jarhead</i> stands today as a landmark contribution to the literature of war. <br /> <br /> Now, in his bold fiction debut, Swofford demonstrates the same audacious vision as he plumbs the legacies of war, the wish for redemption, and the danger of love. <br /> <br /> Seventeen-year-old Severin Boxx lives on Yokota, an enormous American air force base on the outskirts of Tokyo that is home to fourteen thousand U.S. soldiers and a large contingent of long-range nuclear bombers. Just outside the base lies the busy Haijima rail station. Exit A is one of the many doorways into this place of movement, anonymity, and sudden disappearance. Much of the novel's action transpires in the netherworld around Exit A, a mad neon landscape of noodle shops, strip clubs, sushi joints, pawnshops, whorehouses, sake fountains, military surplus stores, tattoo parlors, hash bars, comic book stores, pachinko parlors, fish shops, and alleys -- \\\"the alleys that all lead somewhere, usually down.\\\" <br /> <br /> It's here, not long before the Gulf War begins, that we first meet Severin, an earnest, muscular high-school-football star and son of a base colonel. Like most of the other young American men on the air base, Severin is mad for Virginia Kindwall, the base general's daughter, who is a hafu -- half American and half Japanese. Beautiful, smart, and utterly defiant of a father who wields godlike military power, Virginia has become a petty criminal in the Japanese underground. <br /> <br /> Severin is soon caught up in Virginia's world. But theirs is not a typical high school romance; they fall into trouble way over their heads and are quickly subjected to the enormous, unforgiving tensions between America and Japan -- a relationship still informed by the long shadows of World War II and America's use of the atomic bomb. <br /> <br /> Years later, Severin and Virginia remain lost to each other -- until an emotionally frayed, thirtysomething Severin embarks on a quest to find Virginia and, in so doing, the part of himself taken from him when his boyhood abruptly ended. <br /> <br /> Like <i>Jarhead</i> before it, Anthony Swofford's <i>Exit A</i> is darkly irreverent, frankly erotic, and more than a little wicked, a tale told in a brooding, pained voice filled with the simple human fury of being alive. It is, in sum, a first novel in full. Building inexorably toward a climax that is at once suspenseful and emotionally overwhelming, Anthony Swofford's fiction debut is a triumph.\",\n",

Expanding upon Charles Hapgood’s theory of earth crust displacement, which was championed by Albert Einstein, they examine ancient yet highly accurate world maps, including the Piri Reis map of 1513, and show how the earth’s crust shifted in 9600 BCE, dragging Atlantis into the polar zone where it now lies beneath miles of Antarctic ice. From the Cherokee, Haida, and Okanagan of North America to the earliest records of Egypt, Iran, Mexico, and Japan, they reveal that ancient myths of floods, lost island paradises, and visits from advanced godlike peoples from all corners of the globe all point to the same worldwide catastrophe that resulted in Atlantis’s demise. The authors explain how the remaining Atlanteans, amid massive earthquakes and epic floods, evacuated and spread throughout the world, resulting in the birth of the first known civilizations. <br /> <br />Including rare material from the archives of Charles Hapgood, Albert Einstein, and Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Flem-Aths explain how an earth crust displacement could happen again in the future, perhaps in correspondence with high solar activity. With new scientific, genetic, and linguistic evidence in support of Antarctica as the location of long-lost Atlantis, this updated edition convincingly shows that Atlantis was not swallowed by the sea but was entombed beneath miles of polar ice.\",\n",

No matter if you were raised to call it derriere, tush, rear end, or booty, <i>culo </i>is the new epicenter of female sexuality, desire, and empowerment. <br /><br />Over the past decade, some of the world’s most celebrated women have subtly shifted our long-held ideals of physical perfection toward a shape that is more authentic and bold. While <i>culo </i>has long been venerated in certain cultures, it is now becoming the object of worldwide mainstream admiration. This emerging global love affair with <i>culo </i>is as much about the blending of African, Latin, European, and Asian beauty as it is about celebrating the female form’s most coveted asset. <br /><br /><i>Culo by Mazzucco </i>pays tribute to this phenomenon through a singular artistic vision. In more than 200 photographs and artworks created on location around the world, a diverse group of women—some already legendary, some about to become so—embody the spirit of <i>culo </i>and the start of a new era of beauty.\",\n",

Friends aside, Celia soon discovers something is not quite right at Suburban. Girls at the school begin having near-fatal accidents on the eve of their sixteenth birthdays. Who is causing the accidents, and why? As Celia’s own birthday approaches, she is inexorably drawn into an underground conflict between good and evil—the Kind and the Unkind—that bubbles beneath Suburban High. Plentiful references to music and art—along with the intriguing underworld mythology—make this supernatural series debut a page-turner.</p>\",\n",

She learns that her mother had paranormal powers too, and she hated them so much that she somehow managed to get rid of them. How did she do that? And is that the secret message she has for Sara? Will there ever be a way for them to communicate?<br /> <br />Meanwhile, Sara’s crush, Mason, seems to like her back, but he doesn’t want anyone else to know they’re hanging out. Especially not after a rumor gets started about Sara and her paranormal powers. Sara doesn’t care anymore what other people think—but Mason does, and that’s a problem. When Mason begins to fear that his association with Sara will somehow cause his own paranormal secret to be revealed, Sara has to decide: Will she stand up for who she is, even if it means losing the boy she likes so much?\",\n",

            "  \"description\": \"<b>A “necessary and brilliant” (NPR) exploration of our cultural fascination with true crime told through four “enthralling” (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>) narratives of obsession.</b><br /><br />In <i>Savage Appetites</i>,<i> </i>Rachel Monroe links four criminal roles—Detective, Victim, Defender, and Killer—to four true stories about women driven by obsession. From a frustrated and brilliant heiress crafting crime-scene dollhouses to a young woman who became part of a Manson victim’s family, from a landscape architect in love with a convicted murderer to a Columbine fangirl who planned her own mass shooting, these women are alternately mesmerizing, horrifying, and sympathetic. A revealing study of women’s complicated relationship with true crime and the fear and desire it can inspire, together these stories provide a window into why many women are drawn to crime narratives—even as they also recoil from them.<br /> <br />Monroe uses these four cases to trace the history of American crime through the growth of forensic science, the evolving role of victims, the Satanic Panic, the rise of online detectives, and the long shadow of the Columbine shooting. Combining personal narrative, reportage, and a sociological examination of violence and media in the 20th and 21st centuries, <i>Savage Appetites </i>is a “corrective to the genre it interrogates” (<i>The New Statesman</i>), scrupulously exploring empathy, justice, and the persistent appeal of crime.\",\n",

Lograr una conexión consciente con estos antepasados nos permite transformar legados familiares dañinos en bendiciones, además de impulsar la buena salud, una alta autoestima, claridad de propósitos y mejores relaciones con los parientes vivos. <br /><br />En esta guía práctica para navegar las relaciones con los espíritus de los fallecidos, Daniel Foor detalla cómo trabajar con antepasados vibrantes para transformar patrones intergeneracionales de dolor y abuso y recuperar las bendiciones y los dones del linaje. Los ejercicios y rituales basados en antiguas tradiciones de sabiduría explican cómo iniciar contacto con antepasados, encontrar guías de apoyo, armonizar líneas de sangre, ayudar a los fallecidos que aún no están en paz y cultivar el perdón y la gratitud para lograr avances curativos entre miembros vivos y librar a las generaciones futuras de cargas ancestrales. El autor también describe formas de honrar a los ancestros de lugar, abordar visitas oníricas de los muertos, trabajar con santuarios y altares e incluye instrucciones detalladas de cómo prepararse para la muerte, llevar a cabo ritos funerarios, atender el cuerpo de los fallecidos y, eventualmente, unirse a los antepasados. Foor también explora cómo el trabajo con los antepasados ayuda a transformar toxinas culturales como el racismo, sexismo y extremismo religioso. <br /><br />Los fundamentos de la reverencia y los rituales ancestrales revelan cómo recurrir a la sabiduría de guías ancestrales de apoyo, sanar problemas familiares, mantener conexiones con familiares queridos después de su muerte, ayudar a generaciones futuras a vivir sin cargas ancestrales y entender mejor la compleja e interconectada relación entre los vivos y los muertos.\",\n",

            "  \"description\": \"<b><i>Fighting Back </i>is the story of Stan Andrews, an assimilated American Jew and World War II veteran who became one of the first fighter pilots in the history of the Israeli Air Force.</b><br /><br />“Jeffrey and&nbsp;Craig&nbsp;Weiss have uncovered the story of a Jewish hero in the mold of a Leon Uris character. Readers will enjoy trying to keep up with Stan Andrews—a typical Jewish New Yorker turned daring combat pilot—as he chases history from the air force planes of the United States and the nascent state of Israel.”<br /> –Dan Senor, New York Times bestselling co-author of&nbsp;<i>Start-Up Nation: The Story of Israel’s Economic Miracle</i>.<br /> <br /> “Absorbing and beautifully written,&nbsp;<i>Fighting Back</i>&nbsp;tells the thrilling story of an unlikely American Jewish hero. At a time when some American Jews are distancing themselves from the Jewish state, this book is a powerful reminder of the deep roots connecting American Jewry and Israel.”<br /> –Yossi Klein Halevi, senior fellow, Shalom Hartman Institute, author,&nbsp;<i>Letters to My Palestinian Neighbor&nbsp;</i><br /> <br /> In 1948, Stan Andrews left a comfortable postwar life in Los Angeles to travel to the war-torn Middle East, where a four-front Arab invasion threatened to destroy the newly-declared State of Israel. There he joined the Israeli Air Force and became one of its first fighter pilots.&nbsp; Andrews was an unexpected volunteer for the fight for a Jewish state. He was many things—an artist, writer, assimilated Jew, ladies’ man, pilot, and combat veteran of the Pacific War. He had previously been aloof from the struggle for Jewish independence but found himself so roused by the anti-Semitism of 1940s America that he decided to go to Israel and risk everything. Stan made the most of his time in Israel, serving in fighter and bomber squadrons and leaving his mark on an Israeli Air Force that has since become the stuff of legend.\",\n",

His name is Joseph Smith and in a few short years, he will found his own religion, gather zealous adherents by the tens of thousands, and fracture Emma’s life and faith.&nbsp;</p><p>While the Mormon religion finds its feet and runs beyond the grasp of its founder,&nbsp;Emma struggles to maintain her place in Joseph’s heart—and in the religion that has become her world. The Mormons make themselves outcasts everywhere they go. Joseph can only maintain his authority by issuing ever-stranger commandments on God’s behalf, culminating in an edict that men should marry as many women as they please. The Mormons’ adoption of polygamy only sets them further apart, and soon their communities are ravaged by violence at the hands of their outraged fellow Americans. For Emma, things take a more personal toll as Joseph brings in a new wife—a woman whom Emma considers a sister.</p><p>Emma knows there will never be peace until Joseph faces the law. But on the half-wild edge of the frontier, he’s more likely to find death at the hands of a vigilante posse than a fair trial. For the sake of her people—and her soul—Emma must convince the Prophet of God to surrender... and perhaps to sacrifice his life.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Probes the emotional maelstrom” –&nbsp;<em>The New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p><p><strong>“Fascinating … one of the most interesting and nuanced portrayals of a marriage I’ve read in a very long time … Brilliant.” – Allison Epstein, author of&nbsp;<em>A Tip for the Hangman</em></strong></p>\",\n",

With my family, these were not secrets intentionally withheld. Just truths too painful to confront.</i><br /> <br />In the last years of her life, Teresa Lim's mother, Violet Chang, had copies of a cherished family photograph made for those in the portrait who were still alive. The photo is mounted on cream card with the name of the studio stamped at the bottom in Chinese characters.<br /> <br />The place and date on the back: Hong Kong, 1935.<br /> <br />Teresa would often look at this photograph, enticed by the fierceness and beauty of her great-aunt Fanny looking back at her. But Fanny never seemed to feature in the family stories that were always being told and retold.&nbsp;<i>Why?</i>&nbsp;she wondered.<br /> <br />This photograph set Teresa on a journey to uncover her family's remarkable history. Through detective work, serendipity, and the kindness of strangers, she was guided to the fascinating, ordinary, yet extraordinary life of her great-aunt and her world of sworn spinsters, ghost husbands and the working-class feminists of nineteenth&nbsp;century south China. But to recover her great-aunt's past, we first must get to know Fanny's family, the times and circumstances in which they lived, and the momentous yet forgotten conflicts that would lead to war in Singapore and, ultimately, a long-buried family tragedy.<br /> <br /><i>The Interpreter's Daughter&nbsp;</i>is a beautifully moving record of an extraordinary family history. For fans of&nbsp;<i>Wild Swans, The Hare With Amber Eyes,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Falling Leaves,</i>&nbsp;<i>The Interpreter's Daughter</i>&nbsp;is a classic in the making.\",\n",

It consists of well-known Arabic folk tales penned during the Islamic Golden Age, including “Aladdin’s Lamp,” “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,” “The Three Apples,” “The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor,” and many more. Since their origins they have inspired countless adaptations, most notably the Disney film <i>Aladdin</i>. <br /><br />The stories begin with one of the earliest female protagonists in literature, Scheherazade, who is set to be executed by an evil Arabian king. The book highlights the incredible adventure stories she tells to the king each night, and how she purposefully ends them on cliffhangers in order to peak his interest and survive the next morning. These exciting tales, with their languid prose and wild adventures, form the basis of the book and its narrative arc. <br /><br />Accompanying these timeless short stories are stunning, vintage illustrations by renowned artist Milo Winter, only enhancing their glow and adding to their magic.\",\n",

As one of his generation's preeminent war correspondents, he reported in over 150 countries, many of which were in violent upheaval,<strong> </strong>and was no stranger to witnessing tragedy. But in summer 2019, during the height of India’s erratic monsoon season, Nordland was suddenly faced with a tragedy of his own: he collapsed in the middle of a morning jog, was rushed to the hospital, and diagnosed with a fatal brain tumor.</p><p>After decades chasing conflicts across the globe, Nordland, now confined to a hospital bed, found the strength to face more personal conflicts. He reconnected with his estranged children and became closer with them than he ever thought possible. He repaired a friendship with a best friend that had been broken for twenty years. The arrogance and certitude that dominated his every action was replaced by a lucid sense of humility and generosity that persisted even after he left the hospital. Norland’s tragedy became, in his own words, “a gift that has enriched my life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Waiting for the Monsoon&nbsp;</em>is the exemplary story of confronting death with both eyes open, and of the human capacity to persevere even in the most difficult of times. With tremendous clarity, grace, and courage, Nordland has delivered a powerful final assignment, revealing how facing the unknown can transform experience and change our relationship to the world around us.&nbsp;</p>\",\n",

In 1938 she turns her back on her family&rsquo;s money and status and leaves her comfortable pre-war Sydney lifestyle to become a nurse in a London city hospital. Against the backdrop of looming conflict, she moves to a Red Cross hospital in Paris in July 1939, totally unprepared for the challenge of life in an occupied city. In June 1940 the Germans invade Paris and the young nurse is soon pressured by the leader of the local resistance cell to work for the fledgling movement. Her life is further enmeshed by the arrival of a new Gestapo chief who sets out to seduce her. Marisa&rsquo;s position becomes increasingly precarious as the resistance hunts for a traitor in the organisation. Suspicion falls on one of the hospital&rsquo;s doctors and he is murdered, throwing Marisa into the resistance firing line. As the war approaches its climax, Marisa&rsquo;s Gestapo lover flees and the young nurse follows. He is ultimately revealed as a key operator in a resistance escape line that traverses four countries. But he has a secret which threatens to crush him. Marisa finally discovers the truth behind the man who risked his life to save others in a masterpiece of deception.\",\n",

The combined box office revenue of the <i>Star Wars</i> movies equates to over&nbsp;$10&nbsp;billion, making it the&nbsp;second highest-grossing film franchise&nbsp;of all time. But this&nbsp;franchise is no blaster from the past. Its fantastically successful films have now been followed by multiple television series set in that same galaxy far, far away. The franchise’s flagship television series, and likely the firmest fan favorite for some time to come, is&nbsp;<i>The Mandalorian</i>.<br /><br /> Tracing the tale of the titular bounty hunter, traveling across the furthest reaches of that mythic galaxy, <i>The Mandalorian</i> has been greatly praised and highly acclaimed for creating characters with gravitas and originality, worlds with depth and impact, resulting in some of the best <i>Star Wars</i> content ever. Even though it’s set in deep space, <i>The Mandalorian</i> has as much in common with Western movies as it does with science fiction. Saloons. Bandits. “Gun” duels. Bounty hunters. Outlaws with a price on their heads. Space exploration as a “final frontier.”&nbsp;And a wild hero who doesn’t quite belong in a lawless part of the Galaxy after the fall of the Empire.<br /><br /><i>The Science of The Mandalorian&nbsp;</i>takes you on a badass journey with a mysterious, lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy, where your beskar armor will protect you from many things, but not the sight of a small, green, carnivorous humanoid with big black eyes and mysterious powers. This is the way.\",\n",

The irony is not lost on her. She's a twenty-eight-year-old art major whose last major career accomplishment was being propositioned by the company vice president. Desperate to maintain her freedom from her oddball parents, tyrannical older brother, and slacker ex-boyfriend, Jane starts sending out resumes. So what if some of them aren't exactly, well, true. <br /><br /><i>She's taking the future in stride.</i> <br /> When Jane's dad, a staunchly conservative believer in the corporate dream, loses his job, and her mom goes to work for a trendy dot com, Jane discovers that the family she's taken for granted is unraveling. After a fellow lay-off victim hatches a plot to seek revenge on the office supply company, Jane must choose between living in the past and seeking out a new future. To her surprise, that future might involve a most unlikely partner in crime -- handsome, funny Kyle Burton -- and maybe, just maybe, a new job, too.\",\n",

His childhood was far from easy, with backbreaking hours in the fields, and no opportunity to go to school. But the spirituals he heard as he worked made him long to know how to read the Gospel for himself. Late at night, he taught himself to read from scraps of newspapers. From those small scraps, young Charles raised himself to become a founding father of American gospel music whose hymn was the basis for the Civil Rights anthem “We Shall Overcome.”<br /> <br />Told in lilting verse with snippets of spirituals and Tindley’s own hymns woven throughout, Carole Boston Weatherford’s lyrical words and Bryan Collier’s luminous pictures celebrate a man whose music and conviction has inspired countless lives.\",\n",

After a heavy bout of despair, Brig turned to his faith which had been shelved like a dusty old book. He sensed God asking him, “are you interested in a new approach?” Having nothing to lose, he gave his life to Christ and, in doing so, gave Him the business as well. Over time, Brig realized that he (like everyone) is greatly loved by God.<br /> <br />In <i>Moving Forward, </i>Brig gives us an inside look into his very average life as God unearths truth, knowledge, and lessons from a past full of hurt and pain. Drawing from biblical principles and past mistakes and hardships, Brig shows us that we can stop believing the lies others tell us—and the lies we tell ourselves—that we are not worthy or capable of a more meaningful life. Instead, we all have the ability to move forward and make something great of our lives—if we are willing to trust in God’s direction and use the specific talents he has given to each of us.<br /> <br />&nbsp;\",\n",

Throughout his career, Pence has been adamant about putting his family first. As he often told his staff, he’d rather lose an election than lose his family. <br /> <br /><i>Go Home for Dinner</i> is an in-depth, practical guide to balancing the demands of life with the long-term satisfaction that only a commitment to your family can bring. In this personal account, former Vice President Mike Pence champions one of his most deeply held beliefs: that faith makes a family, and family makes a life. And, through straightforward advice and personal storytelling, he shows readers how to do the same.<br /> <br />In short chapters, Pence walks us through the principles that he and his wife, Karen, developed to raise their family. He gives credit to his parents for setting the precedent of gathering around the dinner table and for being attentive listeners. He discusses how he and Karen prioritized their relationship, even when they struggled professionally through two failed congressional races and personally with infertility. He reveals how he learned to trust God, make difficult choices, and take leaps of faith, all with an eye to what his family needed. He also brings in examples of other friends and colleagues, to demonstrate how these principles look in the lives of other families. The Pence family is far from perfect, but the values portrayed in this book have helped them remain together—and thrive—through their extraordinary journey in public service.<br /> <br /><i>Go Home for Dinner</i> is filled with practical, timeless advice about how readers can pursue their dreams while keeping their family close. This is a book for anyone who wants to achieve their goals and put their family and faith at the center of their life—but who needs a nudge to get home in time for dinner.\",\n",

            "  \"description\": \"Can he walk on water? Can he widen the beach? Can he pluck a star from the sky? Piglet Bo can do all of these things and more. He leaps over tall grasses, blows down a forest, and walks out onto a long pier, as far as it will take him. He looks to the deep sea, and although the pier will take him no farther, Piglet Bo will not be stopped. “I can go into the water,” he says. “If I like. If I dare.” And with a leap of faith, he jumps.<br /><br />Piglet Bo finds friends on his journey—a whale, a pigeon, a bull—and they inspire and help him when they can, but ultimately it takes courage and daring for Piglet Bo to attempt the impossible. Piglet Bo is the bravest and most determined little piglet, with a heart set on adventure. There are no limits to what he can do, and young readers will fall in love with his sweet and endearing resolve. Geert De Kockere writes Piglet Bo’s adventures in simple, playful language, filled with light humor. Tineke Van Hemeldonck’s brilliant mixed-media illustrations bring the story to life, and even the littlest readers will have fun spotting the elusive, lucky four-leaf clover hidden on each page.<br /><br />Sky Pony Press, with our Good Books, Racehorse and Arcade imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of books for young readers—picture books for small children, chapter books, books for middle grade readers, and novels for young adults. Our list includes bestsellers for children who love to play Minecraft; stories told with LEGO bricks; books that teach lessons about tolerance, patience, and the environment, and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.\",\n",

At times this novel moved me to tears, the highest possible compliment.”</strong></p><p><strong>—<em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p><br /><p><strong> With the wit and scope of Michael Chabon’s <em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay,</em> Derek B. Miller tackles his most ambitious epic yet. At its heart is the return of Sheldon Horowitz, the protagonist from Miller’s award-winning first novel, <em>Norwegian by Night,</em> who was lauded by Pulitzer Prize–winning author Richard Russo as “one of the most memorable characters . . . that I’ve encountered in years.”</strong></p><br /><p><strong>MEET SHELDON IN THE MORNING OF HIS LIFE</strong></p><br /><p>Twelve-year old Sheldon Horowitz is still recovering from the tragic loss of his mother only a year ago when a suspicious traffic accident steals the life of his father near their home in rural Massachusetts. It is 1938, and Sheldon, who was in the truck, emerges from the crash an orphan hell-bent on revenge. He takes that fire with him to Hartford, where he embarks on a new life under the roof of his buttoned-up Uncle Nate. Sheldon, his teenage cousins Abe and Mirabelle, and his best friend, Lenny, will contend with tradition and orthodoxy, appeasement and patriotism, mafia hitmen and angry accordion players, all while World War II takes center stage alongside a hurricane in New England and comedians in the Catskills. With his eye always on vengeance for his father’s murder, Sheldon stakes out his place in a world he now understands is comprised largely of crimes: right and wrong, big and small.</p><br /><p><strong>“For me—as I’m certain it will be for every reader of the wonderful <em>Norwegian By Night</em>—Derek B. Miller’s new novel is a genuine literary event (Sheldon Horowitz is back!). Miller has long deserved to be a household name. <em>How to Find Your Way in the Dark</em> should finally make him one.\\\"</strong></p><p><strong>—Richard Russo, author of <em>Empire Falls</em> and <em>Chances Are...</em></strong></p>\",\n",

Sometimes the feeling comes from being truly alone, but it has more to do with feeling alone, unconnected to other human beings. No one likes to feel lonely, but researchers have found that loneliness can actually help us to be better people. It makes us reach out to others. We don't like the way it feels, and so we form connections with other human beings&#8212;and these connections help make our world happier, safer, and more satisfying for us all.

She’s looking forward to a long, relaxing summer of days spent in the sun with her surfer boyfriend, and to secret nights with Rox, the lineup’s queen supreme.<br /><br />But when surf god Nigel breaks her heart, and Rox reveals a secret that tears their friendship—and the lineup—apart, Nani is left to pick up the pieces. If she can’t recruit new Honey Girls to the lineup, the friends will lose their reputation as the beach’s top babes. <br /><br />With the summer spiraling out of control, Nani starts to question everything she’s always believed about how to rule the beach. Maybe it’s time to leave the rules behind, starting with the most important one: <br /><br /><i>Girls don’t surf.</i>\",\n",

Too many leaders embrace the oversized narratives of artificial minds outpacing human intelligence and lose sight of the original problems they were meant to solve.</b><br /> <br />When businesses try to “do AI,” they place an abstract solution before problems and customers without fully considering whether it is wise, whether the hype is true, or how AI will impact their organization in the long term. Often absent is sound reasoning for why they should go down this path in the first place. <br /> <br />&nbsp;<br /> <br /><i>Doing AI</i> explores AI for what it actually is—and what it is not— and the problems it can truly solve. In these pages, author Richard Heimann unravels the tricky relationship between problems and high-tech solutions, exploring the pitfalls in solution-centric thinking and explaining how businesses should rethink AI in a way that aligns with their cultures, goals, and values. <br /> <br />&nbsp;<br /> <br />As the Chief AI Officer at Cybraics Inc., Richard Heimann knows from experience that AI-specific strategies are often bad for business. <i>Doing AI</i> is his comprehensive guide that will help readers understand AI, avoid common pitfalls, and identify beneficial applications for their companies.<br /> <br />&nbsp;<br /> <br />This book is a must-read for anyone looking for clarity and practical guidance for identifying problems and effectively solving them, rather than getting sidetracked by a shiny new “solution” that doesn’t <i>solve </i>anything.\",\n",

            "  \"description\": \"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Written by Herself is an autobiography by African American author Harriet Jacobs, under the pseudonym Linda Brent. It was first published in 1861 by L. Maria Child, who edited the book for its author. The narrative relates Jacobs’ experience of slavery in North Carolina, her escape and eventual emancipation. Initially promoted through abolitionist networks to critical regard, the text received renewed interest in the latter half of the 20th century with the growing civil rights and feminist movements. Today Jacobs’ work is considered, along with the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave, to be one of the foremost works in the slave narrative genre. The text has been considered particularly notable for its depiction of the struggles of African American women and mothers.\",\n",

Najib is believed to be planning the assassination of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is coming to Beirut in ten days to broker a cease-fire. The spy agencies are running out of time to eliminate the threat.<br /> <br /> They turn to a young Lebanese-American CIA agent. Analise comes up with the perfect plan: she has befriended Qassem's grandson as his English tutor, and will use this friendship to locate the terrorist and take him out. As the plan is put into action, though, Analise begins to suspect that Mossad has a motive of its own: exploiting the war’s chaos to eliminate a generation of Lebanese political leaders.<br /> <br /> She alerts the agency but their response is for her to drop it. Annalise is now the target and there is no one she can trust: not the CIA, not Mossad, and not the Lebanese government. And the one person she might have to trust—a reporter for the <i>New York Times</i>—might not be who he says he is…<br /> <br /> A tightly-wound international thriller, <i>Beirut Station</i> is Paul Vidich's best novel to date.\",\n",

Así es como insiste el gobierno que sea llamada esta era, pero la realidad detrás de estas palabras es la hambruna. Liana está en aprietos en su empeño de encontrar suficiente para comer. Y, aun así, el hambre también la ha hecho valiente. Encuentra el coraje para no asistir durante el verano al presunto campamento de trabajo voluntario, aunque sabe que se arriesga a las represalias del gobierno. Cerca de ella, Amado, un tranquilo y apuesto muchacho, también se resiste a obedecer y deambula solo mientras intenta encontrar raras fuentes de comida. <br /> <br />Un encuentro casual con un perro enigmático reúne a Liana y Amado. Unidos en la esperanza y el hambre, pronto descubren que sus sentimientos mutuos son profundos. El amor puede alimentar sus almas y sus corazones, ¿pero será lo suficiente como para soportar el Período Especial?\",\n",
